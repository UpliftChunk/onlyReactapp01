### More Information

Incase of facing issues make sure you made all the below installations of node package modules. npm install in the beginning should already do it for you. But try fixing by typing the installations by yourself.

Install : `npm i react-bootstrap bootstrap react-icons react-hook-form react-router-dom axios json-server`

To have everything else running its must to host the local database Api on your device. This works with the help of json-server.

run : `npx json-server --watch dbusers.json --port=4000` for windows, ignore npx keyword while on mac.
